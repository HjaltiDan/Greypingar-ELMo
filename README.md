# Greypingar-ELMo
ELMo embeddings (ice. "greypingar") trainer using data from the Icelandic MIM-GOLD corpus.

## Main functionality ##
This program was created as part of a natural language programming research project for The Árni Magnússon Institute for Icelandic Studies.

It takes in a number of text files (not included in the repo) and attempts to generate and test ELMo embeddings based on those files.

## Secondary functionality ##

If necessary, the program is capable of creating its own test file set.

It can also create a smaller corpus on the fly, which may come in handy while the user is familiarizing themselves with the code and the best hyperparameter values.
